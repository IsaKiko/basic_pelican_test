This one I'm writing in a python notebook, where the markdown syntax highlighting seems moderately better for some stupid reason.

* a list is coloured ... yay!
    * even its sub point is coloured differntly.
    
# Another heading (highlighted)

And *italics*, which are **important** as to make this work I'm going to have to write the cell to a file ... messy!
